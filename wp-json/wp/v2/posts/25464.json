In the majority of cases, heart diseases take a valuable life, either due to ignorance of the symptoms or the unavailability of medical equipment in remote locations. The lack of accessible, affordable, and portable devices plays a key role in heart health issues, as early detection can prevent heart diseases and save lives. &#8220;We are solving this global health challenge by providing accessible, simple, and affordable product innovation,&#8221; says Rajat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sunfox.in\/about-us\/\">Sunfox Technologies<\/a> started off as a Research and Development lab in 2016 with the mission to save lives through accessible and affordable technologies.

Every year, many people lose their loved ones without saying goodbye due to heart health issues, especially in remote and hilly regions where medical facilities are not easily available. In his own words, &#8220;Patients have to travel at least 40 km to reach primary healthcare facilities, and there is no ECG facility available in such places. Sometimes, by the time they reach the hospital, they either collapse or suffer further complications during the treatment.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tragic loss of a friend led to the inspiration and motivation behind founding Sunfox Technologies. This company was founded with the aim of developing healthcare solutions that are suitable for the Indian condition in terms of durability and portability while being cost-effective. \u201cI am building this venture so that I can contribute my bit to saving millions of lives from preventable heart attacks. We are trying to make an impact on global health with the lean and frugal innovation approach,\u201d says Rajat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunfox Technologies is a new-age medical technology company crafting advanced healthcare solutions for enhanced patient monitoring, improved disease management, and the prevention of heart health diseases.
